# CitiBike-and-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions
Determining the effect that CitiBike has on motor vehicle-bicycle accidents in New York City

In this project, I tried to delineate the potential impact that CitiBike might have on motor vehicle-bicycle collisions, using the motor vehicle collisions dataset provided by NYPD and the CitiBike trips dataset provided by CitiBike.

The extracted data are in the `data_` folder. The generated graphs are in the `imgs` folder. Results and findings are discussed in `paper.pdf`.
